TODO.
 
 1. Dashed stroking is not implemented (yet).

 2. An interface to build attribute and text data from string(s). Currently
    an application needs to do this by itself, the example code being in
    demos/common/text_helper.[ch]pp.

 3. For some glyphs, curve pair glyph rendering is incorrect (this can be determined when
    the glyph data is generated). Should have an interface that is "take scalable glyph
    that is best" in GlyphSelector class.

 4. W3C blend modes are not yet implemented in GL backend, but Porter-Duff blend modes
    are.

 5. Option to unpack brush and frag-shader stuff in fragment shader; the brush data that
    is extracted takes a whopping 24 varying slots:
     flat fastuidraw_varying uint fastuidraw_brush_shader;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_repeat_window_xy;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_repeat_window_wh;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_gradient_p0;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_gradient_p1;
     flat fastuidraw_varying float fastuidraw_brush_gradient_r0;
     flat fastuidraw_varying float fastuidraw_brush_gradient_r1;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_image_xy;
     flat fastuidraw_varying float fastuidraw_brush_image_layer;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_image_size;
     flat fastuidraw_varying float fastuidraw_brush_image_factor;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec2 fastuidraw_brush_color_stop_xy;
     flat fastuidraw_varying float fastuidraw_brush_color_stop_length;
     flat fastuidraw_varying vec4 fastuidraw_brush_pen_color;
  The blend shader, frag shader and frag data take an additional 3 slots
     flat fastuidraw_varying uint fastuidraw_frag_shader;
     flat fastuidraw_varying uint fastuidraw_frag_shader_data_location;
     flat fastuidraw_varying uint fastuidraw_blend_shader;
 
  It might be better on some GPU's to extract this data in the frag shader
  if the GPU and driver can realize that many of the loads are common to
  all fragments in a triangle.
