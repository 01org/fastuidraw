TODO.

 1. Dashed stroking is not implemented (yet).

 2. An interface to build attribute and text data from string(s). Currently
    an application needs to do this by itself, the example code being in
    demos/common/text_helper.[ch]pp.

 3. For some glyphs, curve pair glyph rendering is incorrect (this can be determined when
    the glyph data is generated). Should have an interface that is "take scalable glyph
    that is best" in GlyphSelector class.

 4. W3C blend modes are not yet implemented in GL backend, but Porter-Duff blend modes
    are.

 5. Path tessellation is scale invariant because it is based upon curvature. However,
    if a path (or rounded join) is dramtically zoomed in, we start to see the line segments.
    The way out is to instead use curvature multiplied by arc length and when we stroke
    a path to refine the tessellation by S where S is the operator norm of the
    transformation.
