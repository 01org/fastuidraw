TODO.
 
 1. Dashed stroking is not implemented (yet).

 2. An interface to build attribute and text data from string(s). Currently
    an application needs to do this by itself, the example code being in
    demos/common/text_helper.[ch]pp.

 3. For some glyphs, curve pair glyph rendering is incorrect (this can be determined when
    the glyph data is generated). Should have an interface that is "take scalable glyph
    that is best" in GlyphSelector class.

 4. W3C blend modes are not yet implemented in GL backend, but Porter-Duff blend modes
    are.

 5. *Something* so that atlas sizes in GL backend are initalized to sizes that
    are no larger the maximum sizes for textures.
    a) for ColorStopAtlasGL where for GL3.3, the spec only gaurantees to
       256 layers for array textures. For GL4.3 this value is 2048 which
       is large.
        --> this was real issue on older NVIDIA hardware (GeForce GTS 360M)
            where GL_MAX_ARRAY_TEXTURE_LAYERS is 512 and the default
	    number of layers for color stop atlas is 1024.
    b) for ImageAtlasGL where for GL3.3, the spec only guarantees to 1024 
       for width and height. For GL4.3, the gaurantee is 16384 which is
       HUGE and larger than we would ever use.
    c) for PainterBackendGL where for GL3.3, the spec only guarantees to
       length of 65536 for length of sampler buffer. Worse, this is the
       same value for GL4.3 as well; this limits the sampler buffer to
       only be guaranteed to be safe for a total size of 256K of floats,
       i.e. 1MB.
